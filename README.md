## Overview
"BookLendingClub" is a program request by Gustavo's father to enhance the organization of his son's extensive comic book collection, as well as to manage the lending process for his son's friends.

## Features
The application allows the user to:

1. Manage Friends, Loans, Magazines, and Boxes by adding, editing, and deleting entries, and by viewing them in corresponding tables.
2. Record the type of collection, edition number, year of publication, and box number for each comic;
3. Manage the "box" where the comic is going to get in, adding a unique number, color and tag;
4. Record details of the borrower, including their name, guardian's name, phone number and address;
5. Allow each borrower to take out only one comic at a time;
6. Track the loans records, including the loan date, due date and the status like "ON LOAN", "RETURNED" or "LATE". 
<br> Organizing it into two types of table views:
<br> - Daily view: shows just the loans with status "ON LOAN";
<br> - Monthly view: all the loans recorded.
7. At closing time, one of three different messages can randomly appear to say "goodbye" to you.

## Technology Used
The application was all developed using C# at Visual Studio.

## Conclusion
"BookLendingClub" is an efficient and effective way of managing comic book collections and loan records. With this application, the user can keep track of their collection and loans with ease. 
<br>
<br> One potential improvement for the program would be to add a database to store user information, such as borrower details and loan records, for future reference. This could enhance the program's functionality and allow for better organization of data.
